# QoS + Doze Stress Tester for 802.11 Hardware

## üìå Purpose
This tool is designed to **stress test 802.11 Wi-Fi hardware** by exploiting QoS (Quality of Service) mechanisms and power-saving features (Doze mode). It continuously suppresses targeted client devices by:
- Manipulating **QoS priority levels** to degrade performance.
- Sending **Power Save (Doze) frames** to interfere with normal data transmission.
- Periodically injecting **deauthentication bursts** to disrupt reconnections.

The result is an effective **wireless device stress test**, useful for **analyzing AP behavior**, client-side recovery strategies, and potential **resilience against adaptive interference**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

### **System Packages**
Ensure your system has the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip net-tools wireless-tools aircrack-ng

python3	Required for script execution
python3-pip	Installs Python dependencies
net-tools	Provides ifconfig for network checks
wireless-tools	Manages Wi-Fi interfaces
aircrack-ng	Enables monitor mode & packet injection
scapy
pip3 install scapy argparse

usage example
sudo python3 qos_doze.py -t <Client_MAC> -a <AP_MAC> -i <Monitor_Interface> --deauth-interval 60
Adaptive QoS Manipulation ‚Äì Forces low-priority traffic to degrade performance.
Power Save (Doze) Exploitation ‚Äì Keeps the client device in network limbo.
Randomized Deauth Attacks ‚Äì Prevents easy detection and adaptation.
Fully Customizable ‚Äì Users can tweak parameters for different stress testing scenarios.


Future Improvements

Dynamic AP Detection (Auto-find AP & clients for testing)
GUI Interface for easier configuration
Adaptive Timing (Detect recovery & auto-adjust attack intensity)
